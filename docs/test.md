## Launcher log
```markdown
I need you to upload your Minecraft Launcher's log, You can do so by doing the following:
> **1)** Press the `Windows Key` + `R` at the same time, type `%appdata%/.minecraft/` and press `Enter`
> **2)** Scroll all the way down and open a file named `launcher_log(.txt)`
> **3)** Copy everything (`Ctrl` + `A` and then `Ctrl` + `C`) and paste the text in the `Content` box on https://paste.ubuntu.com/
> **4)** Enter your username in the `Poster` box and click `Paste!`, then give me the link it takes you to.
